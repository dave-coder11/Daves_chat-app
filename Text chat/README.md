# What-to-do
Thank you for downloading my chat app 
the first thing to do is open server.py on your commputer and chose a port that is a 4-digt pass and open client.py on your friends commputer (if you dont have friends go to https://socialself.com/blog/fun-activities-no-friends/) and open client.py on anoter friends commputer tell the the pass and they can talk to each other (and you can see what they say on the server!)

# bye bye
have a great day!
